Hi there! 👋 I'm @jjd214

👀 I'm interested in exploring the vast world of web development, from frontend technologies to backend frameworks.

🌱 I'm currently learning and expanding my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and diving into the exciting realm of responsive web design.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects that involve innovative web solutions or contribute to projects that align with my interests in user experience and interface design.

📫 How to reach me: The best way to connect is through Facebook. Feel free to drop me a message or connect with me there.
